# Facial-detection-system-utilizing-Adaboost-and-Viola-Jones-features

•	Computed the integral images of the entire training and testing image corpus for use in feature extraction

•	Utilized hand-drawn rectangles corresponding to faces (positive examples) and background (negative examples) to extract training features. 

•	Iteratively trained 40 weak classifiers on training features with each iteration reducing the weight of correctly classified features

•	Achieved error of approximately 0.04 after running the 40 trained classifiers on testing image corpus
